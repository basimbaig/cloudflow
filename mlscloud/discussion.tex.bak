{\bf Information Flow Invariants.~}
%
The set of cloud-wide guest SELinux labels form a type system that allows runtime
information flow control. 

Yet we need to caution that any reactive system cannot
be provably secure. 

CloudFlow enacts a best-effort approach that aims to minimize the
vulnerability window during which an attack can be mounted against a target
VM.  In practice however, we observe that the window of vulnerability is so
small (<5ms, Section \ref{sec:evaluation}) that it easily defeats any
existing and forseeable sidechannel attacks which are usually low-bandwidth
and require comparatively ample time to deploy \cite{SideCrypto,SideCloud,PrimeProbe12}
(>hours).

\noindent
{\bf Users \& Groups.~}
%
CloudFlow allows the straightforward definition and enforcement of user- and
group/role-based policies. Roles can be associated with underlying SELinux
labels which can then be used in the policy definitions. 

\noindent
{\bf Centralizing Policy Management.~}
%
Currently CloudFlow is using a database attached to OpenStack as Policy
Store.  Whenever a particular user launches a VM, it needs to also attach
all policies pertaining to it to be propagated along with its VM launch
request.  The target VM host thus only needs to keep track of policies that
are locally relevant.  This significantly reduces the complexity of policy
checking required by the local PolicyD instance and reduces latency for
migration decisions.

The process can be further streamlined by ensuring a default automatic
OpenStack-driven policy to VM mapping and propagation that can determine
applicable policies from the user's session credentials. Moreover, the
existence of a set of cloud-wide policy repository may be desirable from
which users may chose individual subsets of policies of interest. 

Finally, the policy management system would benefit from a (partial)
ordering of runtime labels.  This would enable streamlined conflict
resolution, e.g., a policy may specify that the ``lower'' labeled VM
should be migrated in the case of triggered inter-VM policy conflicts.
