\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We now explore two different performance aspects of CloudFlow. 
The first aspect is the ability to minimize the window of time during which
a particular VM remains vulnerable to side channel attacks, after it has
started a security-critical workload.  CloudFlow provides a best-effort
solution and only a small window of vulnerability exists where the victim
can be targeted.  The aim of the experiments is to find out exactly how
small this window is.  The second aspect is the performance slowdown
experienced within the guest due to constant introspection.  Our
introspection technique is polling based and causes a constant but minimal
overhead.  Finally, VMs may undergo dynamic migration for policy conflict
resolution and the latency of this migration causes the guest to perform
slower.  We minimize the impact of this overhead by scouting out conflict-free migration targets.

\noindent
{\bf Specs.~} 
% 
2.90 GHz Intel i7-3520M nodes with 4GB memory running 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04.1
LTS.  The VMs are running 64-bit Fedora 16 with 2GB of memory. The benchmark
suite of choice was the Phoronix Test Suite \cite{Phoronix}.

\noindent
{\bf Vulnerability Window.~}
%
Since CloudFlow is reactive in nature, a major aim is to minimize the window of
vulnerability during which an attack can be mounted against a target VM. 
The size of this window is precisely the time it takes from the moment a
security critical workload starts to run to the moment an appropriate policy
enforcement is executed.  Since, whenever a runtime label matches a policy
that needs to be enforced, CloudFlow freezes the VM, the vulnerability window
is exactly the wallclock time it takes to do a complete introspection cycle over the
required kernel data structures.

In an initial version of CloudFlow we started using libvirt \cite{libvirt} 
and libVMI \cite{libvmi} as the libraries of choice for KVM-QEMU
introspection.  It became quickly apparent that these libraries are not
designed for low-latency response and the combination is unusable for
meaningful real-time introspection. 
%
% The reason for this turned out to be unnecessary socket communication used for
% IPC within the library and long delays caused by the KVM-QEMU messaging
% systems used to communicate with KVM-QEMU.  
%
Instead, we wrote our own custom fast introspection interface for KVM-QEMU
which sheds all unnecessary libvmi/libvirt overheads and runs within
KVM-QEMU as a thread that can use KVM_QEMU internals directly to read guest
memory.  This allowed us to {\em perform orders of magnitude faster that
existing techniques}.  As shown in Figure
\ref{cloudflow:figure:introspectionwindow}, CloudFlow only takes around
4.7ms wall clock time (less than 2\% of which is CPU time) to perform one
complete pass over all the desired kernel structures.  This figure was
achieved for >50 guest processes running -- the behavior does not vary
significantly with increasing number of processes.

CloudFlow features a low impact introspection design that allows it to
perform significantly faster than existing introspection libraries.  The
shorter the introspection cycle, the smaller the window of vulnerability
during which a VM can be attacked.

CloudFlow has a minimal overhead, below 2\% slowdown in guest workloads. 
Performance slowdown caused by CloudFlow remains well within the normal
variation shown by typical workloads, represented here by the error bars.

\noindent
{\bf Performance.~}
%
CloudFlow is broken down into independently functioning components that
communicate with each other asynchronously.  Out of all the components, the
most computationally intensive module is the introspection module.  The
introspection runs as a thread inside of KVM-QEMU and as a result affects
the runtime performance of the monitored guests.  Figure
\ref{cloudflow:figure:guestslowdown} shows the runtime performance of the
guest operating system with both introspection on and off (lower is better). 

The slowdown caused by CloudFlow introspection is upper bound around 1.7\%
above the baseline performance measured with introspection turned off. 
CloudFlow performs well within the original error bounds of the baseline
performance. All
other components run separately and do not cause any performance impact for
guest workloads.

%Guest performance with introspection on and off (Use Phoronix test suite to do a bunch of tests here. Current ideas: Apache Run, Apache compile, (other computationally intensive tasks). The idea is guest performance should slow down due to constant introspection but we want to show the slowdown is not enormous.

\noindent
{\bf Migration Cost.~}
% 
Finally, the guest VM is also subject to dynamic migration in the case of a
policy conflict.  Whenever this situation arises, the latency of migration
causes a performance hit for the guest.  For our experimental setup, time
taken to do a single migration hovers around the 20 seconds mark -- however
this figure is likely to vary wildly depending on network load, utilized RAM
and volume/disk persistence models (reconnection of volumes to the migrated
VM takes time).  Nevertheless, it is important to note that in most
policies, migration likely gets triggered only when a security critical
service launches and VM relocated is mandated by a policy impacting it. The
non-cloud alternative of having an entire separate machine dedicated to each
individual task is most likely much more expensive.
